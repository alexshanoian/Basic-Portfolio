        Past(pretty boring)
    </h1>
        <p>
            In one of my first memories I am sitting on my grandpa's lap staring at a monitor which is running some ancient Windows XP os. His favorite game was solitare but he would teach me anything he could get me to look at. I played many games growing up and always seemed to have a computer to go to year after year. I loved to play but was too intimidated to try my hand at engineering software for myself, or even manipulating prebuilt systems.

        Present(the current strug)

        <p>
            I found the gonads to try programming for myself through a need of a career path and a life decision which landed me in Seattle (one of the cities which is enriched by the tech giants). Almost all of my money making oportunites have required intense physical labor which at 24 I am already looking for better options. I currently work as a vehicle detailer for 50-60 hours a week while attending the UW bootcamp: Full Stack Flex. A strange new-age dubbed class but with a strong curriculum in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery- mixed with skilled teachers already deep in the software diveloping sphere. My day jobs pays the bills but I am furvently interested in an institution which requires constant attentiveness and intense learning.

    <h3>
        Future(you probably should just read this one)
    </h3>
        <p>
            There is an idea that has been floating around me that I believe could be adapted by the masses and am confused as to why the problem which it solves has not been addressed yet. The solution which I see requires skill in web development and who better to entrust with my idea than myself.
